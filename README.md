# Balsa of Kanbal's Python Adventure

Scenario: You have developed your skills as a developer, learning variable types, loops, and conditionals. Now it's about time for you to put those skills to the test.

You have been tasked by a group of elite developers to create a command line terminal role-playing game. You are asked to create scenarios for the player and submit a pull request on Github. 

Good luck!
